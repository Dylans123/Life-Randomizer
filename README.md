# Life-Randomizer
The purpose of this project is to build a website that will allow the user to make completely random decisions. So far it allows you to randomly decide where to eat based on a search term and your geographic location. I hope to expand its functionality to more aspects of life in the near future. It's built using the Flask micro framework, YELP API, Python 3, CSS, and HTML.
