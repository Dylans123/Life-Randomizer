# Life-Randomizer
The purpose of this project is to build a website that will allow the user to make completely random decisions
that many people often find difficult, like what song to listen to or which restaurant to eat at. It's built 
using the Flask micro framework, YELP API, Python 3, CSS, and HTML.
